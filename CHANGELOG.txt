0.2.1: Bugfix release (2005-07-02)

 - Use get_rev_date_str() instead of get_rev_date() in merge.py because
   get_rev_date returns an adjusted date, have to change that later.
 - Use the right values for copy-from path and revision in __change_node().
 - Open files in binary mode to circumvent windows CRLF bug.
 - Open warn file for writing in eolfix.py.
